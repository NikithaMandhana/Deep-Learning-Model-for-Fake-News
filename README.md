# Deep-Learning-Model-for-Fake-News

In this project, we have built a multi-modal deep learning model for fake news (tweets) detection on social media by using both textual (tweets) and visual inputs (images). This proposed model aims to deal with the automatic detection of manipulation and misuse in Web multimedia content, which lays the basis for a future generation of tools that could assist media professionals in the process of social 
media information verification. The problem we have aimed to solve is the following: "Given a tweet and the accompanying multimedia item (image or video) from an event that has the profile to be of interest in the international news, return a  binary decision representing verification of whether the multimedia item reflects the reality of the event 
in the way purported by the tweet."
